Hi Joe,

I hope all is well with you and your team regarding the launch preparation. As we prepare for integrating the
transaction data into our system, I need your help to finalise the last few details for us to provision things
appropriately on our side.

I tried to keep this email high-level and focused on the key details we need. We want to make sure we implement this
seamlessly without any delays or issues down the road.

Below are the key pieces we need help with:

- Transaction Types
    - How many different types of transactions will there be? Just deposits and withdrawals, or other types as well like
    account open/close, transfers, etc?

- Volume
    - What kind of overall transaction volume are you expecting per day/week once fully launched? Share wider ranges here if
    uncertain.

- Variety
    - Will most transactions follow a standard format, or will there be major differences in data fields/values between
    transaction types?

Our main interest here is making sure we have the right real-time vs batch configuration, and flexibility in our schema
to accommodate what your transactions will look like. We don't want to overengineer and charge you for more than
needed. We also want to make sure we don't constrain your product's transaction abilities.

I know things are super hectic leading up to launch. Let me know if you want to hop on a quick call to chat through
this, or feel free to just respond via email if that's easier. 

Thank you Joe!
